# Credit-Risk-Management-on-Loan-Issuance

In this small project, I estimated the parameters of a logistic regression model from a given sample of 4.400 credit data records. Based on the calibrated model, I then assess the credit quality for a pool of credit applicants. 

The set of data consists of 4.400 records, each with the loan status (1 = bad/default, 0 = good/no default) and 13 predictor variables. Some predictors are numerical, others are qualitative predictors with discrete values (levels).

At the end, based on the credit quality of each applicant, we could decide if we want to grant the loan.
